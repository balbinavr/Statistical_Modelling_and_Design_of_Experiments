EXECUTING FILES

To execute these files R is needed. Just copy them and execute them in your preferred R environment, such as R studio.

They can be found at src folder, and the contents of each file are:

- Allen Cuneen.R: our initial study as well as Allen Cuneen computation. It can plot histograms, Wq, Lq and std dev.
- RSimulationImpl.R: our implementation of the system in R. Outputs values as well as graphics for each rho.
- WqLqComp/WqLqGen.R: compares the results obtained on Java and R computing graphics of the mean + std. dev.
